# DispatchMiddleware

This middleware get the Route Result from the request attributes then returns the response generated by the Route
Result (i.e.: by your Route Handler).

If no route matched the request, then it delegate the response to the next middleware, usually to the
[NotFoundHandlerMiddleware](/bundled-middlewares/notfoundhandlermiddleware), unless you added something in between in
the pipeline.

In 99% of your project, you won't need to modify it.
