## Contribution Guidelines

Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!

### Submitting Pull Requests

We **love** pull requests!  
Before forking the repo and creating a pull request for non-trivial changes, it is usually best to first open an issue to
discuss the changes, or discuss your intended approach for solving the problem in the comments for an existing issue.

For most contributions, after your first pull request is accepted and merged, you will be invited to the project and given **push access**.

_Note: All contributions will be licensed under the project's license._
